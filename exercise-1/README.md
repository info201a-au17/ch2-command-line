# Exercise 1
This exercise is a brief review of terminal commands. Like all exercises, you can see the answers in the `complete` branch. Open up your command-line terminal, and perform the following tasks (no need to clone or download this repository):

 ```bash
# Navigate to your "Documents" directory

# Create a new directory "quick-exercise"

# Navigate to your "quick-exercise" directory

# Create a file called "test-file.r" using the `touch` command

# Open "test-file.r" (from the terminal) and edit it

# View the contents of the file in your terminal

# Bonus: Create 10 files with one line in your terminal
```
