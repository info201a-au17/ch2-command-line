# Exercise 1
This exercise is a brief review of terminal commands. Like all exercises, you can see the answers in the `complete` branch. Open up your command-line terminal, and perform the following tasks (no need to clone or download this repository):

 ```bash
# Navigate to your "Documents" directory
cd ~/Documents

# Create a new directory "quick-exercise"
mkdir quick-exercise

# Navigate to your "quick-exercise" directory
cd quick-exercise

# Create a file called "test-file.r" using the `touch` command
touch test-file.r

# Open "test-file.r" (from the terminal) and edit it
open test-file.r

# Edit in a text-editor of your choice

# View the contents of the file in your terminal
less test-file.r  # Hit "q" to quit viewing the text of the file

# Bonus: Create 10 files with one line in your terminal
touch myFile{1..10}.r  # Google to learn more about brace expansion

```
